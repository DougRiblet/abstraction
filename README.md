Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
